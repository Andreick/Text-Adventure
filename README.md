# Text Adventure :memo:

I did this Unity project watching the recorded video session [Text Adventure Game](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/recorded-video-session-text-adventure-game-part-1?courseId=5c61706dedbc2a324a9b022d) whose goal is to learn about flexible game programming architecture using Scriptable Objects and the Delegate Pattern.
